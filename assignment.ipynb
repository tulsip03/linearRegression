When we do multiple linear regression, you can imagine first regression your and of interest on all the other variables, then saving the residuals, then regressing those residuals on each other. So in part 4 we didn't include the information about the room type, and in part 5 we did. What we're seeing is that some of the variation in prices by rating and neighbourhood is explained by the room types available in those neighbourhoods. Once we control for room type, the other variables become less powerful predictors because some of their predictive power is correlated with room type. That's why the coefficient on rating shrinks."
